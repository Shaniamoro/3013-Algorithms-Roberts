* Description: Create a graph structure with cities as Vertices and
 * no Edges initially. Fully connect your cities by adding edges
 * between cities that are close together. Basically create a
 * connected graph of all the cities so that every city is
 * reachable by ensuring that each vertex has a max degree of 3,
 * where each edge represents one of three closest cities to that
 * vertex.
